        "(use after editing scripts/scenes to find compile errors).\n"
        "  - 'runtime' = cc.log/console.* (and window.onerror) from the GAME "
        "running in the BROWSER preview, forwarded by an injected reporter. THIS "
        "IS THE 'web page' / in-game log the user usually means.\n"
        "By default BOTH sources are returned, so a plain call already includes "
        "game logs. To watch only the game, pass sources=['runtime']; for only "
        "errors add levels=['warn','error']; filter noise with contains=... "
        "(heartbeats like 'KeepLive' dominate); page through new entries with "
        "since=<previous nextCursor>.\n"

        "runtime log capture' in the Cocos MCP panel, restart the editor once, "
